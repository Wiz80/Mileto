##  Overview

Short-term energy demand forecasting is necessary due to the need for the wholesale energy market in the case of Colombia XM to receive reliable expected estimates from network operators. This is due to the fact that if this is not done in this way, costly backup mechanisms have to be incurred in order to supply the difference between generation and demand. 

This is a degree project of the Universidad Industrial de Santander with the objective of training, testing and comparing machine learning models from a friendly and intuitive interface. 

This Django project uses a postgresql database to store structured electric energy demand data and connects to a Google Drive instance through Google Cloud to store the models and the data with which they were trained. Docker-compose is used to perform the deployment of the application using a web service (django), a postgreSQL one and a nginx one as server for redirecting http requests. 

You can enter from the university facilities to mileto.com.co to see the documentation and perform the respective tests on the project, this because it has some restrictions for the deployment at a general level.

Mileto is a comprehensive open-source project designed to streamline the development and deployment process of web applications. The project entails a Docker-based environment orchestrated through a Docker Compose file that integrates a Django web application, a PostgreSQL database, and an Nginx server. By defining services and volumes for the containers, Mileto ensures seamless communication and resource sharing among components, creating a robust development ecosystem. The projects value proposition lies in simplifying the setup and management of a Django web application by specifying dependencies in a requirements.txt file, configuring the Python environment through a Dockerfile, and enabling TCP host/port testing with the wait-for-it.sh' script. Additionally, the mileto.sql file acts as a central configuration hub, managing application settings, routing requests, and ensuring scalability across different environments. Through these core functionalities, Mileto empowers developers to efficiently build, test, and deploy web applications with ease, fostering productivity and reliability throughout the development lifecycle.
